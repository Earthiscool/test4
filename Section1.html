                <h2>2.0 – Business Description</h2>
                <p>Phyto is a company focused on the same goal of revolutionizing your planting experience, with state of the art technology, that is more efficient and effective than traditional technology. With technology that can expedite the process of planting seeds, to innovative software that can find the most optimal growth spot for the plant, we change traditional planting techniques, for both farmers to beginners in gardening. On top of our amazing benefits; we serve people around the world, and have multiple factories across the continents.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>This business is aimed toward taking a new approach to planting seeds, and finding ways to better grow plants. At Phyto we genuinely believe that traditional planting techniques are not efficient and can be improved upon.</p>

                <p>For example, when an individual is manually planting a seed, that will take a lot of time. However, if an individual used our technology, then the seed would be planted in no time, and it would grow really well.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Additionally, we want to change the view on how people view planting, gardening, and farming, from a cumbersome perspective to something that everyone will enjoy. This is because not everyone can spend hours delicately taking care of their garden, and farms, it will take too much time. However, if that individual harnessed machines, these machines would be able to do those tiring tasks and increase productivity in general.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>Additionally, using the technology that we create, we can have a better opportunity to combat climate change. For example, to plant a tree, which is one of the most important tools in combating climate change it takes around 150 to 1800 dollars to properly plant, and around two hours to do. However, with our machines, it would take a fourth of the money, and an eighth of the time. The machines that we create are automated and really easy to use, so not only are our machines helping you, but they are also helping the planet.</p>

                <h2>2.3 – Location</h2>
                <p>The location that we are going to be doing our primary business is Kossuth, Iowa. This is because based on the research conducted this produces the most amount of crops in the whole United States, which means we can start doing real live tests of our products in that area. Additionally, because of the high quantity of crops being made, we can develop machines based on the data points that we have gathered on those farms; making our machines extremely reliable as they are being made for that location. However, with this in mind, we are not saying that machines will only be made for specific regions. Instead, we will make each individual machine based on different aspects of that region, so the person buying our product, gets the most amount of benefit.</p>

                <h2>2.4 – Product Description</h2>
                <p>The products that we are going to create literally have no direct competition in the market. This means, we will be the first to do everything which means no one will have any other product to compare our products to. On top of that, we have sophisticated machines, that if marketed properly, multiple people will buy just to understand the concept of it.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>To make the most amount of money, we are going to be starting slow. Instead of just immediately advertising, we are going to continuously refine our product, making sure there is absolutely no error in the design, or the feasibility of the product. Then, we are going to be advertising in small fairs, and social media so we can build up our foundations. If all of this goes right then we are going to be advertising to big investors and garden influencers so many people will know who we are. With all of this in mind, it looks really costly and expensive. However, we are not going to be advertising like the rest of our competition. Instead of just listing a reasonable price tag and quality machine, we are going to be putting a really big price tag, and extremely quality machine. The main type of target market over here is going to be people who want to see the concept of this technology. After this occurs, we will lower the price tag to a more affordable one that a lot of people can buy, and this will increase our fan base. After we have our foundation, we will follow the plan laid out at the beginning; go to small fairs advertise, then to influencers.</p>
